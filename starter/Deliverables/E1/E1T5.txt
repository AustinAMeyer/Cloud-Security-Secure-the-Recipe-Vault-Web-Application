Based on the architecture diagram, and the steps you have taken so far to upload data and access the application web service, identify at least 2 obvious poor practices as it relates to security.  Include justification.

# Poor practice 1
The S3 buckets aren't encrypted so someone could easily grab the secret recipe
# Poor practice 2
The security group allows access to 0.0.0.0/0 so everyone has full access to everything and will make for an easy attack vector
